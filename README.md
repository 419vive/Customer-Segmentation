<h2>## Overview <a name="overview"></a></h2>
<h3>What the project does?</h3>
The Retail Customer Segmentation Project is a data science project that analyzes customer data to segment them into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. It uses the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to classify customers into different clusters, helping businesses gain insights into their customer base. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques such as K-Means clustering.

<h3>Why the project is useful?</h3>
This project is useful for businesses in the retail industry to better understand their customers' behavior and tailor marketing and sales strategies accordingly. By segmenting customers, businesses can:

*Identify high-value customers and target them with personalized offers.
*Recognize at-risk customers and take measures to retain them.
*Optimize marketing efforts by focusing on the right customer segments.
*Improve overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.
